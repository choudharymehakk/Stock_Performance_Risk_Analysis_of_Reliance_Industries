📊 Stock Performance & Risk Analysis of Reliance Industries


A Data-Driven Approach to Long-Term Investment Evaluation


📌 Project Overview

Investment decisions require more than observing price movements — they demand a structured understanding of growth consistency, volatility, risk exposure, and investor behavior.

This project presents a comprehensive stock performance and risk analysis of Reliance Industries Limited, using historical market data to evaluate long-term growth trends, daily return behavior, volatility patterns, and trading volume dynamics.
The analysis is designed to support long-term investment decision-making using data-driven insights rather than speculation.

1. How has Reliance Industries’ stock price evolved over time?

3. What does daily return behavior reveal about risk exposure?
